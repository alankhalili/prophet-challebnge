**###Module 8 Challenge**
## prophet-challenge

#Steps Performed:
In this exercise, we performed the following:

1. Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic for Mercado Libre
2. Mined the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality using Pandas vizualization tools
3. Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns by merging Goohgle Search traffic with Mercado Libre stock price
4. Created a Time Series Model with Prophet

#Conclusions:
1. The apparent correlation in search had more to do with holidays than earning's releases.  The only clear exception was the first earnings release after COVID became a global health concern.  The growth in earning's confirmed the investor thesis that COVID accelerated the online sales business model.


#Required resouces were:
1. Google trends
2. The company's stock price from static.bc-edx.co
3. Google Colab notebook
4. Access to Meta Prophet
